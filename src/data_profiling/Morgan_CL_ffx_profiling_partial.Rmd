Checking completeness

```{r}
check_complete(select(ffx, 9:15)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
introduce(select(ffx, 9:15))
plot_missing(select(ffx, 9:15))
```

Looking at market value: "The Total Market Value of the Parcel's Land & Improvement values as provided by the county or local taxing/assessment authority"

```{r}
draw_histograms(ffx$mkt_total_value)
```

Looking at tax amount: "The Total Tax amount provided by the county or local taxing/assessment authority"

```{r}
draw_histograms(ffx$tax_amount)
```

Looking at tax_year: "The tax year for which the taxes were billed" 
& assessed_year: "The assessment year for which the taxes were billed" 
(orange is tax_year, blue is assessed_year)

```{r}
ffx <- ffx %>%
  dt_mutate(tax_year = as.numeric(tax_year)) %>%
  dt_mutate(assessed_year = as.numeric(assessed_year))
ffx <- dt_mutate(ffx, year_diff = ifelse(test = tax_year & assessed_year, yes = tax_year - assessed_year, no = NA_integer_))
unique(ffx$year_diff)
```

```{r}
tax_year <- as.numeric(na.omit(ffx$tax_year))
tax_year_counts <- as.data.frame(table(tax_year))

assessed_year <- as.numeric(na.omit(ffx$assessed_year))
assessed_year_counts <- as.data.frame(table(assessed_year))

years <- data.frame("year" = tax_year_counts$tax_year, "tax_year" = tax_year_counts$Freq, "assessed_year" = assessed_year_counts$Freq)
 
ggplot(years, aes(x = year)) + geom_line(mapping = aes(y = tax_year, group = 1), color = "#E69F00") + geom_line(mapping = aes(y = assessed_year, group = 1), color = "#56B4E9") + ylab("frequency")
```


Looking at acres: "CoreLogic derived or county provided value that indicates the total acreage of the parcel"

```{r}
draw_histograms(ffx$acres)
```

Looking at land_square_footage: "Total land mass in square feet"

```{r}
draw_histograms(ffx$land_square_footage)
```

Looking at building__square_feet: "The size of the building in square feet. This field is most commonly populated as an aggregate total when a county does not differentiate between living and non-living areas"

```{r}
draw_histograms(ffx$building__square_feet)
```
