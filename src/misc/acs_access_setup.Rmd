Step 1: Install acs package:

```{r}
install.packages("acs")
```

Step 2: Fill out and submit the key request form at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
You'll get an email with your API key. Copy and paste to use it for the "key" arguement below:

```{r}
api.key.install(key = "")
```

The above function calls only need to be done once. From now on, you can just call the package with:

```{r}
library(acs)
```

whenver you want to use it.
